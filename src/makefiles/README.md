# makefiles

Common makefiles to automate the process of building binaries.

## exe

Builds an executable from all of the `.c`, `.cc`, `cpp` files in the current directory.  Tracks header file modifications / dependencies.

## so

Builds a shared object (`.so`) in a similar fashion to `Makefile-exe`.
